# Multi-dimensional Maximal Coherent Subsets

Maximal coherent subsets are difficult to enumerate, except with hyperectangles aligned on the axes. Illustration on a simple estimation problem with approximations of polytopes.

* experiment_linear.py linear model with an anormal point.
* experiment_multi_linear.py piecewise linear model: linear only locally, not globally.
